        <h1>Partner Portal</h1>
        <div class="project-desc">
          <p>Partner portal is a special product since it connects us to our partners, and our partners to our consumers. Through portal, partners can update their community information which is fed into our call center and into our directory on our website. Partners can also report move ins and manage their leads.</p>

        <dd id="answer-goals" class="answer">The overarching goal was to create a product that would build a better relationship between us and our partners. This included making it easier for users to report move ins and putting a system in place for tracking leads and reporting, as well as transferring most operations into a self serve system.</dd>

        <p>Caring.com offers a directory of senior living options and through a conversation with our call center, we qualify consumers and match them with senior living communities that fit their needs. When a consumer moves into a community we are paid a referral fee. Sometimes, sales managers will say that they got the lead from somewhere else and will not credit us for the move in. This hurts our revenue and the relationship we have with our partners. Despite this behavior being against our contract with partners, there’s not much we can do about it without completely destroying our relationship with them. And so the story of the partner portal is born. </p>
        <p>This is what the portal looked like before:</p>
        <img src="" alt="Old portal image">
        <p>The experience was complex even though the features were not that complex, and there had been no thought put into the flows, the visual hierarchy, or any of the design patterns in the system. For instance, the most important feature, reporting a move in and viewing your referrals was buried under 5 steps and categorized under Community Performance which partners did not recognize as relating to referrals or move ins. </p>
        <h3 class="subtitle">User Pain Points</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Not up to date with current communities, there are duplicates, old rates, old communities</li>
          <li>Cannot update rates in real time</li>
          <li>24 hour time lag for updates</li>
          <li>Impossible to find leads in database</li>
          <li>Can’t send or see updates about a lead</li>
          <li>No reports</li>

          <p>The first step was to get a feel of the flow based on one of our goals: reporting move ins. Which parts could we cut? Which parts were more complex? Are there edge cases?
