          <ol>
            <li>Improve lead ordering with the new lead probability score;</li>
            <li>Send fewer low probability leads per contact;</li>
            <li>Improve call quality and efficiency by making Talk more usable by Sales.</li>
          </ol>
          Improving Talk is an ongoing process and more goals have been added since the first iteration.

          <h3 class="wrapper-title">Background</h3>
          <p>The way Talk works can be summarized as follows:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Sales team calls a contact to gather information</li>
            <li>Sales team uses our search tool to find communities that fit their needs</li>
            <li>They add these leads to the contact and schedule tours if desired</li>
            <li>They email the communities of the new contact</li>
            <li>The contact gets saved in our database for nurture</li>
          </ol>
          <p>Below is what Talk used to look like before I joined:</p>

          <h1>Usability</h1>
          <p>Watching Mouseflow recordings and sitting in on calls showed that the sales flow was often interrupted by searching for form fields to input data. Instead of entering the data into the form fields as the call progressed, a common practice for Sales would be to type notes during a call, referring back to their notes to input the data at the end of the call. I suggested we use category cards to better define where form fields should live so that they would be more intuitive to find. Grouping form fields together didn’t significantly improve the issue though, so I explored other options. I ended up creating well-defined sections that reduced cognitive load, and a more narrow layout that was easier to digest and scroll through. Small visual details like label proximity to form field, line height and white space, and color coded icons also improved the readability of the page. </p>

          <h1>User Feedback</h1>
          <p>One of the main reasons Talk was so difficult to use was because there was no feedback once a user made an action. Error messages were uninformative and “rage clicking” was common for actions that simply took a few more seconds to execute. For example, phone numbers required a certain format and the only error message the user received was: “this number is not in the required format.” With phone numbers, there are more than five possible formats, with five already being too many. Therefore, I restructured that cell to automatically reformat any numerical input to the “required format.” With the help of Mouseflow and Google Analytic events, I noticed “rage clicking” occurred most often when the user was trying to add a lead to the contact. There was no feedback to the user that the action was executed and while the system was thinking, the user was excessively clicking. To solve this, I added a small animation to the button.</p>

          <h1>Lead Ordering</h1>
          <p>One of the exciting new advancements in Talk was implementing machine ordering and algorithms to help better predict move-in probability. I came up with the idea of gamifying Talk, which had the potential to make lead ordering a fun new feature for Sales to use. We wanted them to heed the data and algorithm, but also to make their own decisions as humans talking to humans. Based on the information they provided, and the data we have on communities, the program would order possible leads based on the likelihood that the contact would move into one of them. The more data the Sales team member gathered on the contact, the greater the likelihood of move-in. Likewise, the quality of the contact was increased as more high quality leads were added. Small hearts and broken hearts indicated lead quality and added a fun touch. The point was to serve as a guide but not a rule for the Sales team. We still wanted them to be able to make the final judgement.</p>

          <h1>Conclusion</h1>
          <p>Because of limited engineering resources, we haven’t been able to implement the full extent of gamification that we initially wanted. Still, our move-in numbers remain strong and our relationship with our consumers and partners have strengthened with the new design. </p>
