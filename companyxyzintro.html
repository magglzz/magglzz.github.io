          <h1>XYZ Intro</h1>
          <h2>Context for my time at XYZ and in designing for seniors</h2>
          <div class="line"></div>
          <p>[My company’s name has been changed to XYZ for privacy purposes]. XYZ is a senior living referral service, designed for caregivers seeking information and support as they care for aging loved ones. With their powerful mission statement  “helping the helpers,” it was a joy to join the team as a Senior UX Designer.</p>

        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>In my time at XYZ, I’ve had the opportunity to work on a variety of complex products, from a partner database to an online search tool. One significant challenge of working here has been understanding the user. Our users are 50+ years old and affected by a multitude of vision issues and technical incompetences. However, I have found these to present good design challenges. Working with the users at XYZ has allowed me to  identify and compensate for my own biases, remain objective, seek deeper user research, and design with accessibility in mind.</p>

        <p>I believe that all design should consider accessibility. As technology gets more and more complex, it’s the job of the designer to translate those complexities into something simple for the user. It’s easy to get carried away with a problem and land on solutions that seem creative and unique, but have no ultimate use. When we design for accessibility, it forces us to remember to design for the user and not ourselves. </p>

        <p>Designing for an older demographic also meant that function preceeded form on all accounts. In some cases, I had to sacrifice "beautiful" interfaces for "ugly" ones that the user would better understand. The sacrifice was hard, but well worth it for a product our users would love.</p>

        <p>Here are some lessons I learned while designing for older adults:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Designing for seniors matter, they are one of the fastest growing segments on the web. 10,000 baby boomers retire everyday.</li>
          <li>Designing for seniors will make your site accessible to pretty much everybody else. You are forced to implement good practices since older adults are particularly affected by poor usability standards.</li>
          <li>Seniors hate scare tactics. They are hungry for neutral and unbiased advice. We had to experiment a lot with copy and CTA's that would show positivity and empowerment.</li>
          <li>They read every word on a page and frequently print out information. This meant that we needed a solid layout and colors on all our pages that would be printer friendly.</li>
          <li>They want a human connection. Imagery or references to real people are especially effective in gaining their trust.</li>
        </ul>
         
        <p>Based on what I learned, I established unifying design principles for us to focus our work. They included the following:</p>

        <h2>Accessible</h2>
        <p>We design for an audience that has difficulty using online tools and have aging eyes. We want to welcome these users into a domain they are usually uncomfortable with.</p>

        <h2>Simple</h2>
        <p>We remove color and distractions and enforce consistency so that attention will remain focused on content. We keep all interactions as straightforward as possible and have a bias toward explicit versus implicit interactions.</p>

        <h2>Effortless</h2>
        <p>We always try to think ahead of the user. We preemptively know what questions they will ask at each step of the way and design for that. We tailor copy and design to help with making the user feel like the entire process is seamless.</p>

        <h2>Optimized for Google</h2>
        <p>We need to let people know that we exist and that we are here to help them. We put the most important content ATF, use the right hierarchy of headings, and add a descriptive page title and meta text.</p>
