          <p>Partner portal is a special product since it connects us to our partners, and our partners to our consumers. Through portal, partners can update their community information which is fed into our call center and into our directory on our website. Partners can also report move ins and manage their leads.</p>

          <p>Caring.com offers a directory of senior living options and through a conversation with our call center, we qualify consumers and match them with senior living communities that fit their needs. When a consumer moves into a community we are paid a referral fee. Sometimes, sales managers will say that they got the lead from somewhere else and will not credit us for the move in. This hurts our revenue and the relationship we have with our partners. Despite this behavior being against our contract with partners, there’s not much we can do about it without completely destroying our relationship with them. And so the story of the partner portal is born. </p>
          <p>This is what the portal looked like before:</p>
          <img src="" alt="Old portal image">
          <p>The experience was complex even though the features were not that complex, and there had been no thought put into the flows, the visual hierarchy, or any of the design patterns in the system. For instance, the most important feature, reporting a move in and viewing your referrals was buried under 5 steps and categorized under Community Performance which partners did not recognize as relating to referrals or move ins. </p>

          <h1>Flow Mapping</h1>
          <p>The first step was to get a feel of the flow based on one of our goals: reporting move ins. Which parts could we cut? Which parts were more complex? Are there edge cases? Are there opportunities that we missed? We laid out the organization of the system so that we see areas for improvement and landed on the below IA. </p>
          <p>The organization of the system was designed to accommodate new features that could be added in the future without muddling the most important ones.</p>

          <h1>Editing Community Data</h1>
          <p>One of best ways to ensure a move in is with up to date community information. The more accurate information we have about a community, the better we can match them with a consumer. We decided that it was therefore important to make sure editing data was an activity that was self serve and easy. I started the design with a simple wireframe that laid out all the features up front and then scheduled to interview 6 VIP users, 3 from larger chains, and 3 smaller partners.</p>
          <p>After the first week of interviews, our features and layout was validated and I had a ton of new information. At the second week, I looked closer at the design to see where it could be improved. The table system limited the program, since features could only be added in the horizontal space which was already full. It also didn’t allow the user to see what photos were already there. It also looked particularly lack luster in the cases where there is only one community. I approached the product team and argued for an overhaul of the whole design for a new one that would support both SMB’s and chains.</p>
          <p>The majority of communities that we work with are SMBs, however our biggest partners, where we get most of our revenue, are larger chains and so the design must support both businesses with only 1 community AND businesses with multiple communities. To do this, we added a bulk edit feature that allowed multi community businesses to edit their data quickly.</p>

          </div>
          <h1>Referrals</h1>
          <p>Referrals is now a section in itself with move-ins immediately accessible from that section and also from the referral detail view - these two points were identified as the two steps that always appeared right before reporting a move in. The initial spec for referrals included the following:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>List of all leads that have been sent to the partner</li>
            <li>Report move ins from here</li>
            <li>Show the following data: date sent, statuses, contact name, phone number, resident name, agent name, agent phone number</li>
            <li>Support SMB and chains</li>
            <li>Stars for partners to flag a lead</li>
            <li>Form field for partners to be able to sent an update or add a note</li>
            <li>Access a detailed view of any one referral</li>
            <li>Search for Leads</li>
            <li>Connect to referral emails</li>
          </ul>
          <p>After setting out to create an MVP, we had to decrease scope in some areas. The first version solved a lot of the issues we had with the old portal, but further testing revealed that it still wasn’t that intuitive. So I test out various button placements, tweaked the layout and copy.</p>

          <h1>Conclusion</h1>
          <p>After the initial launch, we have since added more to the product, including a feature to add,edit, and remove users, view and download reports, and send email campaigns soliciting reviews. This product has proved to be a valuable asset to our business and we will continue to grow it and add more features and polish.</p>
