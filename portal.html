          <p>XYZ offers a directory of senior living options and through a conversation with our call center, we qualify consumers and match them with senior living communities. Therefore our service relies on a good relationship with our partners. Partner Portal was born from the need to protect and sustain partner relationships, leading to better service for our users. </p>

          <div class="caption">Portal move-ins page circa 2015. If you don't know the name of your referral, it could take a lot of scrolling to find. There was also a lot of confusion between the Finalize Reporting button and Report Move-in button.</div>

          <p>The user experience reflected a lack of no thought regarding the flows, visual hierarchy, or any of the design patterns in the system. For instance, the most important feature--reporting a move-in and viewing your referrals--was buried under five steps and categorized under “Community Performance,” which partners did not recognize as relating to referrals or move ins. </p>

          <h1>Flow Mapping</h1>
          <p>The first step in the process was getting a feeling for the flow based on one of our goals: reporting move-ins. Which parts could we cut? Which parts were more complex? Are there edge cases? Are there opportunities that we missed? We laid out the organization of the system so that we could see areas for improvement and landed on the below IA. </p>
          <p>The organization of the system was designed to accommodate new features that could be added in the future without compromising the most important ones. </p>

          <h1>Community Profiles</h1>
          <p>One of best ways to ensure a move-in is with up-to-date information. The more accurate the information we have about a community, the better we can match them with a consumer. Historically, communities had only been able to manage their rate information in the Portal. We decided to significantly  expand that functionality in the new Portal by adding the capacity for partners to set and update not just rates, but also images, promotions, and contact information. I started the design with a simple wireframe that laid out all the features up front, followed by scheduling interviews with six VIP users: from larger chain, and three smaller partners.</p>
          <p>AAfter the first week of interviews, our features and layout were validated and I had a great amount of new information to supplement our design. In the second week, I looked more closely at the design to pinpoint further improvements. The table system limited the program to a horizontal space and didn’t support images. I approached the product team and argued for an overhaul of the entire design in favor of a new one that would support both SMBs and chains. The resulting layout has a modular UI with flexible containers to hold varying amounts of information, allowed room for additional features, and can easily be made responsive.</p>

          </div>
          <h1>Referrals</h1>
          <p>Referrals is now a separate section, allowing users to access the most important data with a single click. The initial spec for referrals included the following features:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>List of all leads that have been sent to the partner</li>
            <li>Show the following data: date sent, statuses, contact name, phone number, resident name, agent name, agent phone number</li>
            <li>Support SMB and chains</li>
            <li>Form field for partners to be able to sent an update or add a note</li>
            <li>Access a detailed view of any one referral</li>
            <li>Search for Leads</li>
            <li>Connect to referral emails</li>
          </ul>
          <p>After setting out to create an MVP, we had to decrease scope in some areas. The first version solved many of the issues we had with the old portal, but further testing revealed that it still wasn’t that intuitive. As a result,I played with various button placements and tweaked the layout and copy. </p>
          <p>The flow still had a few tricky areas, but over a few iterations, these were resolved. I found that the two points that always appeared before a move-in was reported were from the Referral Detail view and from the Referrals View. Placing a “report move-in” button on those two pages made sense for the user and we saw a significant increase in move-in reporting. </p>

          <h1>Conclusion</h1>
          <p>After the initial launch, we have since added more to the product, including a feature to add, edit, and remove users, view and download reports, and send email campaigns soliciting reviews. This product has proved to be a valuable asset to our business and we will continue to grow it.</p>
